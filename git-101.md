Here you will know everything you need to know about Git and Git provider(GitHub)

Staging = add

Snapshot = commit locally

Production = working

Push = pull the stuff from local repo to remote

Pull = get the stuff(latest changes) from remote to local

Clone = Creates an instance

Scenario 1: You are starting afresh and creating a local repo and cloning the remote repo

- Create a folder in your local machine

- Create a remote repository on GitHub

- Locate your working directory in command prompt. Execute:
  git init  
   note: this will create an empty git repository in your local machine

- Get the remote repo link (GitHub repo link) and clone that remote repo into local machine
  git clone <remote-repo-link>
  note: this will create an instance of remote repo in your local machine

- Now you can add files or code in the repo using any editor

- Execute
  git status
  note: this command will show you the files you have to stage or once you stage ready to commit and all the info

- Execute
  git add <filename> (this will add only the file given) or
  git add . (this will add all the files and changes made in the repo)
  note: to add the file or code into staging area

- Execute
  git commit -m "commit message"
  note: this will create a snapshot of the state of the file and ready to push remotely

- Execute
  git push
  note: this will send the snapshot and stores the files in remote repo

Scenario 2: Intializing a repository locally and sync it to the remote repository

- git init

- git add .

- git commit -m "your commit message"

- git remote add origin <remote repo link>
  note: all the changes you make in the local repo reflects on this remote repo once to stage, commit and push the code or files.

- git push

  note: git throws a fatal error but why?? but you can fix it! Git tells you what to do JUST DO IT
  why? if you are adding an empty remote repo which doesn't have anything like any brannch to begin with - Git won't possibly know where to push the code - get it?
